# STM32F103 Example DFU Bootloader for fwupd

This bootloader is based on the [usbd-dfu](https://github.com/vitalyvb/usbd-dfu)
stack example bootloader published [here](https://github.com/vitalyvb/usbd-dfu-example),
from [vitalyvb](https://github.com/vitalyvb).

It implements the DFUse extensions (DFU 1.1a), and declares a memory map via USB
descriptor string in the following way:

```rust
const MEM_INFO_STRING: &'static str = "@Flash/0x08008000/02*016Kg,01*064Kg,03*128Kg";
```

The exposed map does not include the bootloader address space 0x08000000 - 0x08007fff
since that confuses fwupd, and it doesn't make sense to expose since the bootloader
can't update itself.

This directory contains a Makefile which should help you flash the bootloader into a
device. Please read the (security considerations)[../../#bootloader-security-considerations].


## Building

To make the bootloader you can use:

```bash
$ make
cargo build --release
   Compiling semver-parser v0.7.0
..
   Compiling dfu-bootloader v0.2.0 (/home/majopela/firmware/et/firmware-on-the-edge/firmware-examples/stm32f103/bootloader)
..
    Finished release [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 15.20s
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/dfu-bootloader dfu-bootloader.bin
```

You will get some warnings on `usb_vid_pid_is_for_private_testing_only` which is just a reminder
about setting your own USB VID/PID.

## Flashing

You can flash your device with the bootloader using `make flash` via dfu-util or `st-flash` if you
have an STLINKv3 connected to your board.

i.e. connected to your board, and power your board while pushing the BOOT0 button, this will
trigget the internal ROM DFU bootloader from the chip.

```bash
$ make flash
sudo dfu-util -d 0483:df11 -a 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D dfu-bootloader.bin
dfu-util 0.11

The bootloader is located at 0x08000000, and uses 32KB. This means that the application
should be compiled to run at 0x08008000 (see the memory.x linkerscript in the application
and bootloader directories).


Once flashed, you can see the device connecting via USB on the dmesg output:

```
[ 116.701570] usb 2-2.7: new full-speed USB device number 120 using xhci_hcd
[ 116.843527] usb 2-2.7: New USB device found, idVendor=2b23, idProduct=e012, bcdDevice= 0.01
[ 116.843555] usb 2-2.7: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[ 116.843560] usb 2-2.7: Product: DFU Bootloader for STM32F411CEU6
[ 116.843564] usb 2-2.7: Manufacturer: Red Hat
[ 116.843567] usb 2-2.7: SerialNumber: c6156613
```

Now when powering up your device, you can use the KEY button if you want to force
your DFU bootloader to stay instead of jumping to your final application when
it's already flashed.
